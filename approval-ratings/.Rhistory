```
This is an introductory course to the R programming language as applied in the context of political data analysis. In this course students learn how to wrangle, visualize, and model data with R by applying data science techniques to real-world political data such as public opinion polling and election results. The tools that you'll use in this course, from the dplyr, ggplot2, and choroplethr packages, among others, are staples of data science and can be used to analyze almost any dataset you get your hands on. Students will learn how to mutate columns and filter datasets, graph points and lines on charts, make maps, and create models to understand relationships between variables and predict the future. This course is suitable for anyone who already has downloaded R and knows the basics, like how to install packages.
## I. Presidential Job Approval Polls
Chapter one uses a dataset of job approval polling for US presidents since Harry Truman to introduce you to data wrangling and visualization in the tidyverse.
### Introduction
#### Selecting Columns of Data
When you're dealing with large datasets, it can be confusing to look at many different columns of data at once. Here, select the `President`, `Date`, and `Approve` columns from the `approval_polls` dataset, and pipe the result to the `head()` function to display the results.
```{r}
approval_polls <- read.csv("gallup_approval_polls.csv")
```
```{r}
# Import dplyr
library(dplyr)
# Select President, Date, and Approve from approval_polls
approval_polls %>%
select(President, Date, Approve) %>%
head()
```
#### Filtering Rows of Data
When your data is time series — the rows of the data frame come from information taken at different points in time — like ours, it often spans over different events. Here, the dataset covers different presidents who are evaluated differently by the public, and we're only interested in one for now: the current U.S. president, Donald Trump.
```{r}
# Import dplyr
library(dplyr)
# Select the President, Date, and Approve columns and filter to observations where President is equal to "Trump"
approval_polls %>%
select(President,Date,Approve) %>%
filter(President == "Trump")
```
### Averaging Job Approval by President
#### Averaging Approval Ratings by President
It is often useful to compare groups of observations to each other. In the Gallup approval ratings dataset, we can compare the popularity of each U.S. president to each other by taking an average of all the polls taken during their administration. This way, we'll know who were the most and least popular U.S. presidents, and gain insight into who were the best and worst.
```{r}
# Group the approval_polls dataset by president and summarise a mean of the Approve column
approval_polls %>%
group_by(President) %>%
summarise(Approve = mean(Approve))
```
#### Averaging a column
Often, it helps to focus our attention on one or two observations in order to benchmark our expectations for the broader dataset. In this exercise, we average only the polls of President Donald Trump's approval ratings.
```{r}
# Extract, or "pull," the Approve column as a vector and save it to the object "TrumpApproval"
TrumpApproval <- approval_polls %>%
select(President,Date,Approve) %>%
filter(President == "Trump") %>%
pull(Approve)
# Take a mean of the TrumpApproval vector
mean(TrumpApproval)
```
### Visualizing Trump's Approval Over Time
#### Averaging President Trump's Approval By Month
When analyzing data that occurs over time, you want to make sure there are enough data points in any given interval that when you take a `mean()` or `median()` that the measurements don't have too much variance. Accomplish this by setting wide windows of time: e.g. months instead of weeks.
```{r}
# Load the lubridate package for wrangling dates
library(lubridate)
# Select the relevant columns from the approval_polls dataset and filter them for the Trump presidency
TrumpPolls <- approval_polls %>%
select(President,Date,Approve) %>%
filter(President == "Trump")
# Use the months() and mdy() function to get the month of the day each poll was taken
# Group the dataset by month and summarize a mean of Trump's job approval by month
TrumpPolls %>%
mutate(Month = months(mdy(Date))) %>%
group_by(Month) %>%
summarise(Approve = mean(Approve))
```
#### Calculating a Rolling Average of Polls
If you wanted to know the effects on public opinion of the big events of a presidency, you would want to see how a president's approval rating had changed over time.
```{r}
# Save Donald Trump's approval polling to a separate object
TrumpApproval <- approval_polls %>%
filter(President == "Trump") %>%
mutate(Date = mdy(Date)) %>%
arrange(Date)
# use the rollmean() function from the zoo package to get a moving average of the last 10 polls
library(zoo)
TrumpApproval <- TrumpApproval %>%
mutate(AvgApprove = rollmean(Approve, 10, na.pad=TRUE, align = "right"))
```
#### Visualizing Donald Trump's Approval Polls
When analyzing time series data, it is often helpful to visualize the trend over time. In R it's very easy to visualize data with ggplot2!
```{r}
# Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
# Use ggplot to graph Trump's average approval over time
ggplot(data = TrumpApproval, aes(x=Date,y=AvgApprove)) +
geom_line()
```
#### Bonus: Visualizing Every President's Approval
In this exercise, you will create and graph a moving of approval ratings for all the presidents since the early 1900s.
```{r}
# Create an moving average of each president's approval rating
AllApproval <- approval_polls %>%
group_by(President) %>%
mutate(AvgApprove = rollmean(Approve, 10, na.pad=TRUE, align = "right"))
# Graph an moving average of each president's approval rating
ggplot(data = AllApproval, aes(x=Days, y=AvgApprove, col=President)) +
geom_line()
